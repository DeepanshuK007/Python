Modules are used to borrow others code. 
There are two types of modules:
1). Built in Modules.   2). External Modules.

1. Built in modules come along with python installation and external modules are the one which are installed using pip command.

External modules are written by others and saves a lot of time in coding and also a lot of memory.
pip is a package manager which if given command to will downlord the required external lib in our system

Using the terminal also u can write code using a REPl (Read Evaluate Print)
